    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the last lesson, you saw how the for loop gave you the power to loop through a list of items. In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn more about working with lists, and see how <b>lists</b> and loops together make for powerful programming patterns. You‚Äôll also focus on problem-solving using loops, and find out how do you break a problem down into pieces so that you can write a program to solve it.\n",

    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After this week, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use lists to store and manipulate data\n",
    "- Use loops and lists together to solve common programming problems\n",
    "- Break programming problems into small parts and gradually build up a solution\n",

    "# What is a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "In your life, you‚Äôve come across all kinds of lists - grocery lists, todo lists, the attendance roll at school, the roster of your football team. Lists in Python are a way to represent many pieces of data, like you do on those lists. Instead of just one number, string, or boolean, a list can hold many pieces of data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with lists in your life, there are a few core actions you perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list\n",
    "- Add something to the list\n",
    "- Remove something from the list\n",
    "- Change an item on the list\n",
    "- Take some action for all of the items on the list\n",
    "- In this lesson, we‚Äôll cover the syntax for creating lists and updating lists, and performing these core actions.\n",
